# Version 1.0.1

Converted all maps to jpegs to reduce file size, because, OMG, webps are fat. Still working on this, but it's better.
Removed gridlines from all maps and cleaned things up. In a few cases, I shrank the size of the actual map.
Converted all portrait images to jpegs as well. Changed a few portraits that had weird eyes.
Switched all tokens to use assets from Forgotten Adventures.
Numerous textual changes and tweaks.
